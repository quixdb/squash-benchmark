# Squash Compression Benchmark Web Site

This is the web site used to present the official results for the
Squash Compression Benchmark.

This is the development version—to see the latest stable version (run
against the latest stable version of Squash), please visit the
[Squash Compression Benchmark web site](https://quixdb.github.io/squash-benchmark/).
There is currently no live view of the development version, but you
can always clone the repository.  You'll need to run it with a web
server (`python -m SimpleHTTPServer` works) so the links to external
resources work.
